        <h3>Giap Nguyen</h3>
        <p>Giap started Straight to the Point Archery in 2005. He's an avid and accomplished
          archer himself, having competed with the United States Archery Team in the 2000
          Summer Olympics. He has three children, and started Straight to the Point in part
          because he was not satisfied with the archery eduction options for them in Tacoma.
          After The Hunger Games books and movies came out, he noticed a surge in popularity
          of archery among young people, especially young women, and the business has been
          booming ever since.</p>
